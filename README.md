# LiamDillingham-tictactoe
The Tic-Tac-Toe game I created my sophmore year of high school
The state of the project has not changed since the 10th grade of high school,
thus the coding style may be very messy, the code is unoptimized, and so on.
I do not know if github modifies files in any way, but the dates on the files read back to 10/11/2011

This application features a basic tic-tac-toe game in which the user can choose to play against another human locally,
or choose to play against the simple AI written into the application.  Score is kept after each consecutive game,
and can be cleared.
